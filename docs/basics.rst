FFCV basics
===========

At a basic level, working with FFCV just requires two steps:
1. :ref:`Converting an existing dataset into FFCV format<Writing a dataset to FFCV format>`, and
2. :ref:`Making FFCV dataloaders <Making an FFCV dataloader>`.

In :ref:`Working with Image Data in FFCV`, we give more details on working with image data,
including how to finetune to your specific resource requirements.

In :ref:`Parameter Tuning`, we give recommendations on how to optimize your system for a couple of common use cases.
