Welcome to FFCV's documentation!
================================

View `Homepage <https://ffcv.io>`_ or on `GitHub <https://github.com/MadryLab/ffcv>`_.

Install ``ffcv`` with `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html>`_:  ``conda install ffcv``

``ffcv`` is a package that we (students in the `MadryLab <https://madry-lab.ml>`_) created to
make training machine learning models *fast* and *easy* to use.
Below we provide a detailed walkthrough of complete examples, basics of using FFCV, extensive benchmarks on ImageNet, and (coming soon!) advanced customizations.
